1. Pet Profile ManagementMulti-Pet Registry: Supports individual profiles with name, breed (Pug, Puggle), and a dedicated avatar.Pet-Specific Data: Each profile can hold unique data sets, such as weight tracking over time.2. Event & Medical LoggingCategorized Entries: Users can log different types of events including Vet Visits, Medication (e.g., Heartworm injections), Vaccinations, and General Appointments.Multi-Pet Logging: A selection interface allows users to attribute a single event (like a group ear check) to multiple pets simultaneously to save time.Historical Timeline: A chronological "Home" feed displaying past events with summaries, time stamps, and the author of the log.3. Health Monitoring & AnalyticsGrowth/Weight Tracking: A visual line graph showing weight fluctuations over several years (e.g., Captain’s growth from $10.7\text{ kg}$ to $14.3\text{ kg}$).Data Archiving: A list view of specific measurement entries with the ability to edit historical data.Proposed EnhancementsTo move beyond a simple logbook and into an "Intelligent Pet Assistant," I recommend the following features:1. Automated Reminders & Predictive SchedulingSmart Recurring Alerts: Instead of just logging a Heartworm injection, the app should automatically prompt a reminder for the next dose based on the product used (e.g., monthly or annually).Vaccination Countdown: A dashboard widget showing "Days until next Parvo shot" so owners aren't caught off guard.2. Integrated Medical Records & PDF ExportDocument Vault: The ability to upload and OCR (Optical Character Recognition) actual vet invoices or lab results.Vet Report Generation: A "One-Click Export" that compiles a pet’s entire history (weight, meds, allergies) into a PDF to email to a new vet or a pet-sitter.3. Nutrition & Activity CorrelationCalorie Calculator: Based on the weight tracking seen in your screenshots, the app could suggest daily caloric intake based on the pet's age and activity level.Activity Syncing: Integration with wearable pet trackers (like Tractive or Fi) to overlay exercise data against weight trends on the same graph.4. Advanced Group ActionsHousehold Sharing: A "Family" mode where multiple users (e.g., you and your wife) can sync logs in real-time so no one double-doses a pet.Bulk Medication Logging: An "All Pugs" toggle for recurring treatments like flea/tick meds to reduce taps even further.5. AI Health InsightsSymptom Checker: A simple AI-driven chat or checklist to help determine if a "lump near bum" (as seen in your Lols log) requires an emergency visit or a standard checkup.Trend Analysis: Notifications if a pet’s weight deviates by more than $5\%$ in a short period, which can be an early warning sign of health issues.6. Multimedia EnrichmentHealing Progress Timelines: For skin checks or injuries, a dedicated "Photo Log" that lets you swipe through daily photos to see if a wound is actually improving.
